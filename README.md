<b>Project Scoping and general questions.</b>

Is there on average a higher number of observations based on location? 

What species have the highest rate of concerning conservation status?

Does the species type seem to influence a higher or lower risk to a conservation status?

Is there any correlation in data that may help us determine the conservation status? 

1. Review data to get a general idea of the values we are looking at.

2. Determine if any data values can help answer questions we have regarding the data and if any can be compared to find any correlations.

3. Analyze data to try and answer our questions and possibly gain new questions to get a better understanding of the data.

4. Evaluate analysis to resolve any unanswered questions and provide answers/ possible solutions.

5. Create visuals and write explanations showing how are answers to these questions came to fruition.
